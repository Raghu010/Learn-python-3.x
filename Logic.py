#collection of programs is called module.
#collection of modules is called as package.
#PIP is a command used to install python packages.
#Module : Is nothing but storing a logic in one folder with .py extension and using this logic in other program whenever required.
#Import : Is the keyword used to import the logic from the folder.
#From : Is also a keyword used while importing the logic.
#Note: Module programming is done in IDLE not in jupyter lab.
#Jupyter lab is a user defined module.
#Note: Return statement within the logic can not be used because it returns the value to the function not to the importing programe.
#Few in-built modules in python are:
#1.Math
#2.OS
#3.Time
#4.Operator
#5.Calendar
